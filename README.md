📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Indian Premier League (IPL) data to extract meaningful insights about player performance, match impact, and team contributions.
The goal is to transform raw cricket data into actionable insights using SQL, Excel, and Power BI, following proper data analytics workflow.

This project demonstrates my ability to:

Clean and prepare raw datasets

Write optimized SQL queries

Build interactive dashboards

Communicate insights clearly for non-technical stakeholders

🎯 Objectives

Analyze player-level performance across seasons

Identify top-performing players based on key metrics

Understand match impact through runs, wickets, strike rate, and economy

Create interactive Power BI dashboards for decision-making

🗂 Dataset Information

Source: IPL historical dataset (CSV format)

Data Type: Structured sports data

Key Columns Include:

Player Name

Team

Matches

Runs

Wickets

Strike Rate

Economy

Season

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

SQL – Data cleaning, transformation, and analysis

Excel – Initial data exploration and validation

Power BI – Interactive dashboard creation & visualization

CSV – Raw dataset storage

🔄 Data Cleaning Process (SQL)

Removed duplicate records

Handled missing and inconsistent values

Standardized column formats

Ensured correct data types for analysis

All cleaning logic is documented in the SQL scripts for transparency and reproducibility.

📈 Key Analysis Performed

Top run scorers and wicket takers

Player consistency across seasons

Batting strike rate vs match impact

Bowling economy vs wickets taken

Team-wise player contribution analysis

📊 Dashboard Highlights (Power BI)

Interactive filters for season, team, and player

KPI cards showing key performance metrics

Visual comparison of players across different parameters

Clean, minimal, stakeholder-friendly design
