## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes **IPL player and match performance** using a structured data analytics workflow.  
The objective is to convert **raw cricket data** into **clear, actionable insights** through proper data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

The project demonstrates real-world **Data Analyst skills**, including:
- Data cleaning & validation  
- SQL-based analysis  
- Dashboard storytelling for non-technical stakeholders  

---

## 🎯 Business Objective
- Identify **top-performing players** based on key metrics  
- Analyze **match impact** of batsmen and bowlers  
- Understand **team dependency vs balanced performance**  
- Build an **interactive dashboard** for easy decision-making  

---

## 🗂 Dataset Details
- Format: CSV  
- Type: Structured sports data  
- Key Fields:
  - Player Name  
  - Team  
  - Matches  
  - Runs  
  - Wickets  
  - Strike Rate  
  - Economy  
  - Season  

---

## 🔄 Data Preparation – Excel
Excel was used for **initial data understanding and preprocessing**:
- Checked data structure and column consistency  
- Identified missing and invalid values  
- Performed basic filtering and sorting  
- Validated numerical columns (runs, wickets, strike rate)

This step ensured the data was ready for SQL-based transformation.

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Analysis – SQL
SQL was used to handle **core data transformation and analysis**:
- Removed duplicate records  
- Handled missing values logically  
- Standardized column formats  
- Created calculated metrics for performance comparison  
- Extracted player-wise and team-wise insights  

All SQL logic is documented in separate scripts for transparency.

---

## 📊 Data Visualization – Power BI
Power BI was used to build an **interactive and stakeholder-friendly dashboard**:
- KPI cards for key performance metrics  
- Player and team comparison visuals  
- Filters for season, team, and player  
- Clean layout focused on storytelling  

The dashboard is designed for **quick insight generation**, even for non-technical users.

## 📈 Key Insights Summary
- Consistent performers contribute more than occasional high scorers  
- Strike rate has a strong influence on match outcomes  
- Balanced teams outperform star-dependent teams  
- Efficient bowlers create higher match impact through economy control
